// Follow the directions below.  Do not change the code above this line.

//1.  Write a console log statement to log the result of num1 multiplied by text1

//2.  Use typeof() to check the data type of the result of the calculation you performed in step 1 and log it to the console

//3.  Write a console log statement to log the result of text1 multiplied by text2

//4.  Use typeof() to check the data type of the result of the calculation you performed in step 3 and log it to the console

//5.  Write a console log statement to log the result of text1 added to text2

//6.  Use typeof() to check the data type of the result of the calculation you performed in step 5 and log it to the console

//7.  Write a console log statement to log the result of num1 added to num2

//8.  Use typeof() to check the data type of the result of the calculation you performed in step 7 and log it to the console

//9.  Write a console log statement to log the result of text1 added to num1  

//10.  Use typeof() to check the data type of the result of the calculation you performed in step 9 and log it to the console

//11.  Use the Number() method to convert text1 to a number and save the result to the variable converted1.  Log converted1 and its type to the console.

//12. Repeat the calculation you performed in step 10, this time adding converted1 to num1.  Log the result and its data type to the console.

//13.  Use the toString method to convert num1 to a string.  Log the result and its data type to the console.
